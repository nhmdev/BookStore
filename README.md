# BookStore
A sample app for a book store. 

This project is created for a school assignment. The assignment goals is to do a database, website and PowerBI solution 
for a Book Store. Its assigned 16 hours and that is why lots of functions has been left out.

Description of assignment:
A customer wants a proof of concept solution for a Book Store. The solution needs to include datamodel, database code, 
a simple website to manage orders and a PowerBI Desktop file. PowerBI reports the customer wants is to see the top selling
products, top and bottom customers.

Functions that has been left out but should be implemented for better security:
* All primary keys are of datatype INT. For better security it would be changed to GUIDs.
* Passwords for logins are saved in clear text. For better security it would be good to have SHA-1 encoding.

Functions that the customer might want in extended PoC.
* More information fields might be interesting for the customer. For example products ISBN and customers address.
* Better category solutions. For example multiple categories per product and subcategories.
